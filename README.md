# SaaS

A bad idea, taken too far.

Or, the one true SaaS: /etc/services as a service!

## Overview

Inspired by a [joke tweet](https://twitter.com/sveiss/status/1095538449132613633),
I set out to discover if you really could serve /etc/services over LDAP.

A [helpful blogpost](http://karellen.blogspot.com/2011/12/migrating-etcservices-into-ldap.html) showed the schema elements needed, and the rest is proof you just can't take a bad joke too far.
